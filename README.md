# Hinglish-Translation-App
Welcome Message: When you run the program, it starts by welcoming you to the "Hinglish Translation App."

User Input: The program waits for you to type something. You can type a sentence or a few words in English that you want to translate into Hinglish.

Translation: Once you've entered your English text, the program uses a special tool to convert it into Hinglish. This tool knows how to change English words into a mix of Hindi and English, making it easier for people who speak Hindi to understand.

Display Translation: After performing the translation, the program shows you the result. You'll see your original English text along with its translation into Hinglish.

Repeat or Exit: You can keep using the app as many times as you want. Just type more English text when prompted, and it will translate it for you. When you're done using the app, you can type 'exit,' and it will stop and exit the program.
